"""
Module with additional functions to OR-Tools CP-SAT model and solver that allows for:

* multiple-objective modelization
* modelization of relaxable constraints (contraints that are not mandatory but are seen as an objective)
* explanation of infeasibility for infeasible problems
* local explanation of result for feasible problems
* production of natural language explanations
* easier local optimisation (LNS)...
